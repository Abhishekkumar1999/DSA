## Bruteforce
<ul>
  <li>Iterate over all the values of nums and delete the nodes in LL which contains nums[i]</li>
  <li>Time complexity here would be n*m</li>
</ul>

## optimization 1
<ul>
   <li>Put all the values of nums in a hash</li>
   <li>Iterate all the nodes of the LL and if the value of the nodes present in the hash means it would have deleted, so donot put it in new LL other put the node val in new LL</li>
   <li>return the new linked list</li>
   <li>Time complexity would O(n+m)</li>
</ul>

## optimization 2
<ul>
   <li>Put all the values of nums in a hash</li>
   <li>modify the existing LL if the such that if node is not present in nums, no need od deletion or creation of new node</li>
   <li>Time complexity: O(n+m), but we save the time and space for new node creation unlike the previous optimization</li>
</ul>
