// TOPIC: Condition Variable In C++ Threading
// IMPORTANT POINT: CV are used for two purpose
//
//A. Notify other threads
//B. Waiting for some conditions
// 1. Condition Variable allows running threads to wait on some conditions and once those condition are met then waiting thread is notified using
    // a. notify_one();
    // b. notify_all();
// 2. You need mutex to use condition variable.
// 3. If some thread want to wait on some condition then it has to do these things:
    //a. Acquire the mutex lock using std: :unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(m) ; â€¢
    //b. Execute wait, wait_for and wait_until. The wait operation will automatically release the mutex and suspend the execution of the thread.
    //c. When the condition variable is notified, the thread is awakened, and the mutex is atomically reacquired. The thread should then check the condition and resume waiting if the wake
    //up was spurious
// NOTE:
// 1. Condition variables are used to synchronize two or more threads.
// 2. Best use case of condition variable is Producer/Consumer problem.
